## Laravel Website

This is the source of the official [Laravel website](https://laravel.com).

### Documentation

The website's documentation is loaded from the `resources/docs` directory. You will need to clone each version of the documentation into this directory. For example, `resources/docs/5.3`, etc. All of the documentation is stored on GitHub at [laravel/docs](https://github.com/laravel/docs).
